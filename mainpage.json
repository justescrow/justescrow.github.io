[{"id":5865,"question":"Is there any chance to loose funds during Atomic Swap","answer":"<h4>Risks associated with the Atomic Swap process<\/h4>\r\nAt the moment, the biggest risk is the inaccessibility of public nodes or spam of the blockchain. For example, let's take such situation\r\n\r\n1. Alice and Bob have frozen funds in smart contracts\r\n2. Alice tries to withdraw funds from ethereum smart contract and sends the secret with a low gas price (the secret becomes visible to everyone)\r\n3. Bob sees the transaction and starts a DoS attack in which he starts spamming ethereum ito prevent the transaction mining.\r\n4. Bob withdraws BTC from a Bitcoin script (since the secret is already known)\r\n5. After a timeout, Bob sends a refund transaction with an increased gas and withdraws ETH\r\n\r\nSuch attack makes sense when the amount of exchange is more than $ 10,000 (the minimum cost of gas). It also may happen accidentally\r\n\r\nThere may also be a risk that\r\n1. The node will not accept a Bitcoin transaction for withdraw (transaction is too small or spam)\r\n2. public node suddenly becomes unavailable\r\n\r\nAll these scenarios should be worked out by additional analysis of the state of all systems on which a successful swap depends.\r\n\r\n<strong>How to remove the risk:<\/strong>\r\nDo not let the swap start if the nodes are unavailable, as well as be able to quickly switch nodes, replace the transaction if it is long mined, give the user an opportunity to complete the swap by manually sending the transaction manually.\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n\r\n<h4>Risks associated with the orderbook.<\/h4>\r\nSuch risk assumes that an attacker can somehow start a swap with an unprofitable course for the victim. We check that the course during the swap coincides with the course in the order, but the atack process is not yet developed\r\n\r\nWhat is planned to do: to audit the work of the order book,\r\n1. check how it works in flood conditions.\r\n2. check the possibility of exhibiting extremely large or extremely small exchange rate values\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n\r\n<h4>The risk of starting a swap but not completing it.<\/h4>\r\nFor example, lets consider such attack.\r\n1. Alice places an order to sale ETH\r\n2. Bob accepts it but does not freeze bitcoin, until timeout\r\n3. Alice cannot start swap with others.\r\n\r\nHow we will solve: users will have rating which depends on successful trades and how many SWAP tokens they hold in wallet\r\n\r\n<hr \/>"},{"id":5834,"question":"Is it difficult to add a new blockchain to your exchange?","answer":"The Atomic Swap is a complex operation which consists of multiple software\/hardware elements controlled from different world regions. E.g, here is just a couple of the systems (elements):\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Multiple public nodes.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>libp2p messaging system.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Two blockchains.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Smart contracts written on different languages with different processing features.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Public explorers.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>External monitoring services (e.g. mining fee calculator).<\/li>\r\n \t<li>User's browser as the swap logic executioner (not only frontend but the entire dApp).<\/li>\r\n \t<li>The user as his or her actions affect the swap.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<strong>Mining fee.<\/strong> How much is the fee and which fee is optimal? How this fee will be calculated? How much cryptocurrency will be spend in both blockchains and who will pay this amount of crypto? Which sum will be final for the maker to send and for the taker to get?\r\n\r\n<strong>Blockchain features.<\/strong> E.g. for the ERC20-tokens the operation should be 'approved' and client must have some ETH to receive the tokens. For the EOS, the paid account activation is required. This problems shouldn't be of user's concern.\r\n\r\n<strong>How do the public nodes work?<\/strong> Three public nodes activity is required during the swap (two blockchains and orderbook). What if one node works better than the other or is blocked in some countries?\r\n\r\n<strong>Correct swap recovery after the update of page.<\/strong> How the swap progress can be recovered from the last point if some problem occured and page was updated?\r\n\r\nWe elolve. We update our system timely and the blockchains' interoperability management takes time."},{"id":5738,"question":"Request is declined. Why?","answer":"(if you try to sell 1 SWAP token try less amount, 0.99 for example)\r\n\r\nWe are a marketplace, where other participants trade with each other. If you receive\"Request is declined\", then the other participant does not want to exchange with you at the moment. Our platform cannot know the reasons why this is happening.\r\n\r\nCommon causes of rejection:\r\n\r\n-Your account is not credible (few exchanges)\r\n-The other party is currently already sharing with you or with someone\r\n-The other side lacks funds\r\n\r\n<strong>What ca i do?\r\n<\/strong>You can view other offers by clicking on \"Orderbook\""},{"id":5259,"question":"How long it takes to exchange?","answer":"It depends on the blockchain you perform a transaction with. For example, for the pair BTC&lt;&gt;ETH it takes less than 40 seconds to receive funds in ETH wallet and up to 3 minutes to receive funds in BTC wallet."}]
